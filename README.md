# Codemagic.gr

## About

__[Codemagic.gr](http://codemagic.gr) is a powerful online web-development Code Editor that lives inside your browser__! It's open-source and it follows the philosophy of client-side and fast execution. It's built for creative people who do a lot of web-related experiments and want to test stuff in real-time without the hassle of preparing project files and whatnot. It is also a great place for people to come and learn various web-technologies like HTML, CSS, JS and their derivatives.

### Web-related Technologies

* Markup: HTML, Markdown
* Stylesheet: CSS, LESS, SASS
* Script: Javascript

## Features:

* As much as possible client-side execution
* Syntax Highlighting
* Color Schemes
* Intelisense (with Ctrl + Space)
* Live linting
* Supports [Emmet](http://emmet.io)'s magic
* Multiple cursors and selections
* Bracket auto-pairing
* Code-folding
* Code beautification
* Indentation with spaces or tabs
* Change font-size and tab-size values
* Displays hidden characters
* Import external libraries and frameworks for CSS and JavaScript
* Live Auto-Complete (not implemented by ace.js yet)

### Coming soon

* Markup: HAML, Slim, Jade
* Stylesheet: Stylus
* Script: CoffeeScript

### Abilities:

* Sign-in and save your example to your profile (public/private)
* Fork any example you have access to (either yours or public example of other people)
* Download the whole project in a .zip file (which includes your .html, .css and .js files)
* Share your code with other people by either embedding it to another page, or via a link

_The features and capabilities mentioned above will require server-side execution/compilation and therefore can't be implemented until Codemagic.gr's back-end is ready_.
